## CuffCompare
* compare and evaluate the accuracy of RNA-Seq transcript assemblers (Cufflinks, Stringtie). 
* collapse (merge) duplicate transcripts from multiple GTF/GFF3 files
* classify transcripts from one or multiple GTF/GFF3 files as they relate to reference transcripts provided in a
annotation file (also in GTF/GFF3 format)

This program is also distributed as part of the Cufflinks suite (see manual: http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffcompare/).
